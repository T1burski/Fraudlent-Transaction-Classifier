# Fraudulent-Transaction-Classifier

This is a ML project focused on developing a model and ML App that classifies a financial transaction as fraudulent or not. This kind of data-driven classification is key in order to guarantee the security in financial institutions.

## 1) The Problem to be Addressed
Financial institutions all over the world, specially the ones related to services associated with monetary transactions, suffer from security issues such as a false transaction, also named a fraudulent transaction. These happen, generally, when a client's account is accessed by a third illegal party to transfer money or buy things (products, services, etc). So, the following challenge stands for these institutions: Can we automatically detect, in real time, if a transaction is a fraud in order to cancel its execution, protecting the company and the client?

With the advance of data-driven solutions such as machine learning algorithms, this task can be done. For example, supervised classification models based on historical data that represents the behaviour and occurrance can be trained in order to judge future transactions, labeling them as fraudulent or not. With this being said, the present project tackles this challenge using the mentioned strategy: through machine learning models, we will develop a tool that predicts if a transaction is fraudulent or not based on previous occurrances.

## 1) The Data
Real data from transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders will be used to develop the ML model. The data can be obtained in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.
